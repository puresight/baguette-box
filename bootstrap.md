- [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/) tools
- [Github](https://cli.github.com/) tools

Homebrew is used for **some** the language stack and CLI tools. The packages to be installed are listed in the `Brewfile`  
including Goose & Aider ✨

## Rust

[Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) is installed using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
The _cargo binstall_ tool is added for quick package installation because the standard _cargo install_ command downloads source code and compiles it on your machine, which can be slow. To bypass this and install pre-compiled binaries, use the community-standard tools like [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall). This is the most popular method. it automatically searches for pre-compiled releases on GitHub or other registries.
Usage: Replace `cargo install <package>` with `cargo binstall <package>`
