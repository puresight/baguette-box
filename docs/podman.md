# Podman

[Podman](https://docs.podman.io/) is an open-source, Linux-native container engine designed to develop, manage, and run Open Containers Initiative (OCI) containers and pods. It is daemonless and rootless by design, allowing users to run containers without root privileges, which enhances security. Podman offers a Docker-compatible command-line interface, making it a popular, secure alternative for container management.
