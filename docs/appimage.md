# AppImage

[AppImage](https://appimage.org/) is a portable software format for Linux that bundles an application and its dependencies into a single file, allowing it to run on almost any distribution without installation or root permissions. Apps require only that the file be made executable. [AppImageHub](https://www.appimagehub.com/) indexes over 1500+ apps.
